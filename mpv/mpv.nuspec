    <description>Package maintainer's note: This package contains the official Windows builds of mpv. mpv.exe and mpv.com are hardlinked to chocolatey's bin folder- without mpv.com in the path, there will be no terminal output.
	    Because of this unique setup, a shim is not needed, and not used. While this is a portable package, you will be asked if you wish to run this script https://github.com/rossy/mpv-install/blob/master/README.md, which
	    requires administrative access.
mpv is a fork of mplayer2 and MPlayer. It shares some features with the former projects while introducing many more.

-Streamlined CLI options
	MPlayer's options parser was improved to behave more like other CLI programs, and many option names and semantics were reworked to make them more intuitive and memorable.
-On Screen Controller
	While mpv has no official GUI, it has a small controller that is triggered by mouse movement.
-High quality video output
	mpv has a OpenGL based video output that is capable of many features loved by videophiles, such as video scaling with popular high quality algorithms, color management, frame timing, interpolation, and more.
-GPU video decoding
	mpv leverages the FFmpeg hwaccel APIs to support VDPAU, VAAPI, DXVA2, VDA and VideoToolbox video decode acceleration.
-Active development
	mpv is under active development, focusing on code refactoring and cleanups as well as adding features. Want a feature? Post a patch or request it!
